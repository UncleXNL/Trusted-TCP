# Trusted-TCP(TM) (C)
  TTCP(TM) is a new kind of TCP,  extremely secure, especially when it uses
a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to store the encryption keys and do the
encryption outside computer memory, so it can't be hacked by software
alone. TRUSTED-TCP(TM) TTCP(TM) Copyright (C) 2016  Remi van Dongen
